A test for Kaufland.
- [Live version >>](http://uoowuo.github.io/kaufland-test/)

Frameworks are chosen with a view to expand and maintain the application in the future:
- Bootstrap, because it's been a common way to do breakpoints & standard UI components for some years now.
- React, because it is a popular view for MV*, and may stay relevant for a few years.
